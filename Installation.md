# Tutorial: Installation #

The Protein Hypernetwork Software Suite consists of two independent packages: **ProteinHypernetworkEditor** and **ProteinHypernetwork**.

To install the each package, download the corresponding .jar from the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/proteinhypernetworks/downloads/list) page.
The obtained .jar file can be executed with a JAVA 6 or later virtual machine to launch the program. Depending on your operating system, this can be done in several ways:
  * Mark the file as executable and open it with JAVA. To mark a file as executable, in general, you right-click on the file and open its properties, where you find a corresponding check mark under "permissions".
  * Open a terminal and run the command `java -jar pathtothefile.jar`

In any case, make sure that your operating system does not open the .jar file as a file archive.

On older versions of MacOS X, you need to make Java 6 the default JVM. This can be done by opening the "Java Preferences" application.
